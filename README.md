# Datadog Proxy for ComputerCraft

This is a proxy that turns ComputerCraft HTTP requests
into DataDog statsd UDP messages.  It's designed to be
used with the (included) companion DataDog/statsd
Lua library that sends raw requests to the proxy.

See "computercraft" directory for the API and an example script.
